# MP_Neuron
# MPNeuron Model – McCulloch-Pitts Neuron

A simple implementation of the **MP Neuron (McCulloch-Pitts Neuron)** in Python, demonstrating how binary threshold-based neurons can be used to simulate basic logic gates like AND, OR, and NOT.

## 🧠 What is an MPNeuron?

The MP Neuron, developed by McCulloch and Pitts in 1943, is one of the earliest computational models of a biological neuron. It uses binary inputs and produces a binary output based on a threshold function.

This project serves as an educational introduction to neural computation and lays the foundation for understanding artificial neural networks.
